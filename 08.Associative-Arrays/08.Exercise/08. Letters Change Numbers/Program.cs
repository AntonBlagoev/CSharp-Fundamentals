/* Nakov likes Math. But he also likes the English alphabet. 
 * He invented a game with numbers and letters from the English alphabet. 
 * The game was simple
 * You get a string consisting of a number between two letters. 
 * Depending on whether the letter was in front of the number or after it, 
 * you would perform different mathematical operations on the number to achieve the result.
 * 
 * First, you start with the letter before the number.
 * •	If it's uppercase you divide the number by the letter's position in the alphabet.
 * •	If it's lowercase you multiply the number with the letter's position in the alphabet. 
 * 
 * Then you move to the letter after the number.
 * •	If it's uppercase you subtract its position from the resulted number.
 * •	If it's lowercase you add its position to the resulted number.
 * 
 * But the game became too easy for Nakov. 
 * He decided to complicate it a bit by doing the same but with multiple strings keeping track of only the total sum of all results. 
 * Once he started to solve this with more strings and bigger numbers, it became quite hard to do it only in his mind. 
 * So he kindly asks you to write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers after the operations on each number have been done.
 * 
 * For example, you are given the sequence "A12b s17G":
 * 
 * We have two strings – "A12b" and "s17G". We do the operations on each and sum them. 
 * We start with the letter before the number on the first string. 
 * A is Uppercase and its position in the alphabet is 1. 
 * So we divide the number 12 with position 1 (12/1 = 12). 
 * Then we move to the letter after the number. b is lowercase and its position is 2. 
 * So we add 2 to the resulting number (12+2=14). 
 * Similarly for the second string s is lowercase and its position is 19 so we multiply it with the number (17*19 = 323). 
 * Then we have Uppercase G with position 7, so we subtract it from the resulted number (323 – 7 = 316). 
 * Finally, we sum the 2 results and we get 14 + 316=330.
 * 
 * Input
 * The input comes from the console as a single line, holding the sequence of strings. Strings are separated by one or more white spaces.
 * The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
 * 
 * Output
 * Print at the console a single number: the total sum of all processed numbers rounded up to two digits after the decimal separator.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * •	The count of the strings will be in the range [1…10].
 * •	The numbers between the letters will be integers in the range [1…2147483647].
 * •	Time limit: 0.3 sec. Memory limit: 16 MB.
 * 
 * Examples
 *
 * Input | Output | Comments
 * A12b  s17G | 330.00 | 12/1=12, 12+2=14, 17*19=323, 323–7=316, 14+316=330
 * P34562Z q2576f   H456z | 46015.13 |
 * a1A | 0.00
